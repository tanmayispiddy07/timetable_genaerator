# Time Table Generator 📚🚀

A sophisticated Time Table Generator developed to simplify and optimize the scheduling process for academic institutions. This project, built on concepts from Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA), applies Greedy algorithms and constraint programming to handle complex constraints like teacher availability, subject continuity, and workload management.

## 📌 Project Overview

In academia, creating timetables that accommodate multiple classes, subjects, and teacher preferences is a challenging, time-consuming task. This Time Table Generator automates this process, leveraging efficient algorithms to generate schedules that satisfy all constraints.

## 🛠️ Key Features

- **Constraint Programming**: Manages various constraints, including:
  - Teacher availability
  - Subject continuity and workload balance
  - Optimized class and teacher allocations
- **Greedy Algorithm Approach**: Implements a Greedy algorithm for quick and efficient timetable creation.
- **Real-World Problem Solving**: Translates academic DSA theory into a real-world application, tackling scheduling challenges in a practical and effective manner.
- **User-Friendly Solution**: Reduces the workload for educators and administrators, providing a balanced and structured timetable in minimal time.

## 📈 How It Works

1. **Algorithm Selection**: Research and selection of appropriate algorithms, including Greedy techniques, to meet scheduling requirements.
2. **Constraint Handling**: Incorporates constraints based on teacher schedules, subject distribution, and workload limits.
3. **Timetable Optimization**: Generates well-optimized timetables that maintain subject continuity and balance workloads across multiple classes and years.
